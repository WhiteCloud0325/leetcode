Question:
Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Answer:
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left<right){
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (nums[mid]<nums[right])
                right = mid ;
            else if (nums[mid]>nums[right])
                left = mid + 1;
            else{
                if (nums[left] == nums[mid]){
                    ++left;
                    --right;
                }
                else
                    right = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
}
};
