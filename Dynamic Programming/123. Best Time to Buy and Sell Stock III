Question:
ay you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Answer:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int hold1=INT_MIN,hold2=INT_MIN;
        int release1=0,release2=0;
        for(auto i:prices){
            release2=max(release2,hold2+i);
            hold2=max(hold2,release1-i);
            release1=max(release1,hold1+i);
            hold1=max(hold1,-i);
        }
        return release2;
    }
};
